      <p>What are the Eight Principles of ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics that software engineers shall adhere to?<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Public: Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.</li>
        <li>Client and Emolpyer: Software engineers shall act in manner that is in the best interest of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.</li>
        <li>Product: Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.</li>
        <li>Judgement: Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgement.</li>
        <li>Management: Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.</li>
        <li>Profession: Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.</li>
        <li>Colleagues: Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.</li>
        <li>Self: Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practive of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.</li>

    <li>
      Discuss whether professional engineers should be certified in the same way as doctors or lawyers.<br>
      <ul1>
        When negligence practice occurs in medical or law practices, the impact can affect the public financially and physically.
        Certification allow the public to trust services which they seek from the professionals. Like wise, if software engineers
        are licensed or bored certified, it could show that their services can be trusted.
      </ul1>

    <hr class="questions">
    <li>
      What are the four important attributes that all professional software should have? Suggest four other attributes that may sometimes be significant. <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Maintainability</li>
        <li>Dependability and Security</li>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Acceptability/Usability</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Other attributes that are significant are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Response time</li>
        <li>Interactivity</li>
        <li>Reliable </li>
        <li>Evolution</li>

    <hr class="questions">
    <li>Suggest why it is important to make a distinction between developing the user requirements and developing system requirements in the requirements engineering process. <br>
      <p>The distinction between developing the user requirements and system requirements in the requirement engineering process as follows:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Developing User Requirements</th>
          <th>Developing System Requirements</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Abstract statements. Which described the system's functions and features of customer needs.</td>
          <td>Provided a more detailed explanation of the procedure.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Must be develop in accepted language and might not be communicated in depth detail to tolerate certain execution flexibility.</td>
          <td>Communicated in depth detail to tolerate certain execution flexibility.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The starting level of the project, development team may put interest on gathering information, identifying the important things and understanding them correctly.</td>
          <td>Implemented after user requiremnts have been established. Development is important form the beginnign of a project to end and beyong programmers must have the knowledge and skill to write program applications. </td>

    <li>
      Apart from the challenges of heterogeneity, business and social change and trust and security, identify other problems and challenges that software engineering is likely to face in the 21st century (hint: think about the environment). <br>
      <ul1>
        <li>
          The legacy challenge: <br>
          <p>
            The challenge of maintaining and updating this software in such way that excessive cost are avoided and essential business services countinue to be delivered.
            Engineers should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents, copyright, etc. They should be careful to ensure that the intellectual property of employers and clients is protected.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Competence:<br>
          <p>
            Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is outwritting their competence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          The delivery challenge:
          <br>
          <p>
            The challence of shortening delivery time for large and comple systems without compromising system quality. Respect the confidentiality of the employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been
            signed.

    <hr class="questions">
    <li>Giving reasons for your answer based on the type of system being developed, suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems:<br>
      <ul1>
        <li>A system to control anti-lock braking (ABS) in a car. <br>
          The most appropriate generic software process model in a car is Waterfall model.
          The anti-lock braking is a safety-critical system. In Waterfall Model, the analysis and design requirements must schedule without any flaws before implimenting of the system for the proper functioning of the ABS system of the car.
        </li>
        <li> A virtual reality system to support software maintenance. <br>
          Most appropriate generic software process for a virtual reality system to suppoer software maintence is Incremental development.
          The requirements of the system will change and cannot be predicted before the implementation and require complex programming for the software.
          The software is not a critical system.
        </li>
        <li>A university accounting system. <br>
          The requiremnts of this system can be predicted in advance because of existing system.
          This is mission-critical system and requirements are stable and resuable. Thus, the most appropriate generic software for a university accounting system that replaces an existing system is integration and configuraton.
